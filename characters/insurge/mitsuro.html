      <ul>
        <li>He's a huge geek, obsessed with video games and comic books. He is known to frequent comic book and hobby shops, and is partial to the one Takaji works for. He had known Takaji prior to the events of Insurgence because they would often run into each other at said shop, before Takaji was even employed there.</li>
        <li>He's a very amateurish inventor, making barely functioning devices out of scraps. However, he's improved drastically after learning from Eisuke. Not to say he's anywhere near his level...</li>
        <li>He makes his own explosives from scratch. He tries not to make them too widespread or lethal, but he's definitely messed up a few times.</li>
        <li>He is very into skateboarding, and first got into it because of his favorite comic book character.</li>
        <li>Due to his mother getting lethally ill following his birth, he sees himself as a bad omen of sorts. He swears bad things will happen when he's around, and is quick to blame bad things on his presence. </li>
        <li>Mitsuro would get constantly demeaned and berated by his father simply for existing. He would at first get labeled as a "killer," but it eventually turned into just shaming him for everything whether it be being useless, not being like his sibling, insulting his intelligence, etcetera. As a result, he is extremely hard on himself, very often parroting that he is worthless. </li>
        <li>He aspires to make his own comic series someday, and often shows his friends the wacky new concepts he comes up with.</li>
        <li>He loves explosives because they remind him so much of his favorite comics that are riddled with so many explosion-esque special effects.</li>
        <li>Mitsuro, as eager as he is to share his interests, is also very protective of them. For instance, he has been known to hate movie adaptations of his favorite comics as they "destroy their integrity" and dislikes when people online show bias to the movie versions of the story. He doesn't use "traditional" social media and prefers to stick to forums. Eisuke and Takaji don't have the heart to tell him that that's kinda lame.</li>
        <li>Mitsuro knows quite a bit of English from spending time online and reading English comics. Though he is far from fluent.</li>
