    <div>
      <p style="overflow-y: auto; height: 250px; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; font-size: 13px;">Eisuke is a genius engineer with a sharp tongue full of sarcasm and a permanent poker face. He's not very good at expressing his feelings let alone understanding them. He also struggles with communicating and getting along with others, though he is very loyal to those he holds close and values them deeply. He's highly aware he's more intelligent than those around him, using 'idiot' as his go-to insult and getting annoyed when people don't understand concepts he finds super simple. Regardless of this, he really doesn't have an ego and will never claim to be better than anyone. He's known to hate those kinds of people, believing they're 'douchebags.' He has very strong morals that he follows to a T, even if they can be a bit questionable at times. He sticks to his guns even if he knows everyone or most people will be against him. He's an avid problem solver and strategist, known to approach things through a very logical lens for better or worse. For instance, technical problems are no issue to him, however, he can be quite difficult to lean on emotionally. Eisuke has been very lonely throughout his life, never truly feeling close with anyone due to what he believes are his own shortcomings. He had skipped many grades as a child, thus never got a chance to really befriend anyone, especially not anyone his own age. Too used to being alone and rather socially stunted, even when presented opportunities in present day, it can be hard to connect with him. He unintentionally pushes people away and refuses to "show himself" to them. But after breaking through that difficult barrier, he's a very caring person who desires the positive well-being of everyone around him. He's also quite nerdy, being very into gaming, collectibles, manga, and documentaries. He has a massive sweet tooth as well that he feels ashamed of, often indulging in cheesecake from his favorite cafe. Eisuke dislikes when people see through his 'stoic genius' "facade" as he feels that's what everyone expects him to be, plus he wouldn't be taken seriously as said genius if people knew otherwise. Later in life (sequel), Eisuke has become very unstable and compulsive, doing things such as washing his hands over and over again. His strong moral compass would slowly start to fade as he'd find himself getting his hands dirty (no pun intended) more and more, contrary to his desire to lead a normal life. He becomes very miserable and uncontrollable as the life he wanted along with all his opportunities would fade away. He was born a prodigy who everyone around him believed would do amazing things someday, only to just let everyone down. Despite still taking pride in his genius and talent, he views himself as a failure in this regard.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>His favorite food is cheesecake, especially from his favorite cafe near home</li>
        <li>He is narcoleptic, and often falls asleep in any situation. He also has a weaker constitution, though he likes to act like he doesn't.</li>
        <li>He first made Charlie when he was little, though of course he was barely functional back then. He has continued to work on him ever since.</li>
        <li>He was born and raised in America and originally moved to Japan to attend the tech university his father went to before deciding to stay indefinitely. His parents warned against him going, but he was very adamant about it.</li>
        <li>He has skipped many grades due to his intelligence and academic advancement which really took a toll on his social skills, not that they've ever been particularly great. He graduated university at 13 years old, receiving a bachelor degree in various fields of engineering. He is the only Insurgence character who has been able to pursue a college education.</li>
        <li>His father was a former Botan Corp employee who fled to America because of his rogue clone.</li>
        <li>He's really shy about it but he loves video games a lot, both playing them and the craft itself. Especially as a programming nerd he finds them very admirable. He fears this could ruin his erudite image and only shows this side of himself to Mitsuro and Takaji. Later, Kohshiroh. Though, most everyone is aware.</li>
        <li>He's incredibly fixated on Pokemon and likes to bring it up whenever the opportunity arises. His favorite is Magnemite because it reminds him of Charlie.</li>
        <li>Aside from the genius stuff a lot of Eisuke's character is based on myself. He is also the first oc, out of the ones I still use, that I created.</li>
        <li>Eisuke isn't very into music, but very surprisingly, he enjoys metal after Kohshiroh showed it to him. Though, he has to listen to it with the volume low which irritates Kohshiroh.</li>
