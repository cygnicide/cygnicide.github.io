      <p style="overflow-y: auto; height: 250px; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; font-size: 13px;">Kohshiroh is a very troubled individual to say the least, facing harsh mistreatment and taking lives since she was little. Nowadays, she has a tough hardened exterior, though she has tendencies to enter a more erratic state in a snap. It's relatively unpredictable, but can be expected when she feels threatened or is invested in combat. He prefers to stay away from others, believing himself to be a monster that shouldn't be intermingling with other humans, especially after hurting people around him on multiple occasions. He talks in a very brash and blunt manner, but deep down is far too caring and afraid to hurt others to take things too far. It's very hard to break through Kohshiroh's extra tough exterior, as she refuses to let herself become vulnerable and lose the only protection she has. Few have had success other than her little brother Mitsuro, and her sequel partner Eisuke. She still very much struggles to express herself and her feelings around them, but she feels much safer doing so than she would with anyone else. She loves everyone a lot, but she feels as though expressing that is opening herself up to danger and hurt. Kohshiroh is very smart, way more than anyone gives him credit for often due to aforementioned erraticism. He's incredibly strategic and rational, on top of possessing a lot of experience. Such as, being a seasoned fighter and killer for that matter, accepting hits put out by his father at his demand ever since he was young. He deeply regrets everyone he ever hurt, but due to believing he could never properly integrate into society, he has kept this career going minus the required targets, only targeting those he truly believes are â€˜scum.' This has caused internal conflict within him in which he wants to quit but also wants to save those whose voices go unheard so that no one has to live like he did. She knows these people will walk free if she doesn't do anything. No one else will. He is very self sacrificial and doesn't seem to value his own life very much both because of his own suffering and his need to protect the innocent and anyone he holds close. Due to the imprint her father left, she very much struggles to express her femininity no matter how much she wants to. She fears being judged for not fitting the mold everyone expects her to. Not even just with her outwards expression, but expressing her emotions at all. She's never been able to properly cope with the damage her father caused, but as of the sequel, she's doing her best to improve herself and find her place in the world as her own person. She's an avid artist, music, and fashion lover, hobbies she had to hide while her father was around, but has come to express them a little more freely. He actually has a very soft side, though it's very much Eisuke exclusive. Even then, these moments are few and far between. She is selflessly caring towards her favorite people, and very happy to simply be in their presence as long as they give the same care and safe place in return.</p>

    <div style="font-size: 13px; padding: 20px 20px 20px 0; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>She's an artist who especially loves pen sketching and painting though she abandoned this for awhile for lack of approval from his father</li>
        <li>He doesn't get much sleep, only being able to in the mornings. At night he takes care of personal business.</li>
        <li>People like to assume she's completely insane and thus lacks intelligence, which couldn't be further from the truth. She is severely mentally ill, but that doesn't impact his intelligence. He's very smart and probably the second most intelligent of the main cast. She's known to be very calculated and strategic when she needs to be.</li>
        <li>While in the old days he would simply kill whoever his father told her to regardless of their innocence, nowadays she chooses to only target more depraved individuals, like for example, those who bring harm to children.</li>
        <li>She is one of few characters who intends to prioritize mafia work for the rest of her life and doesn't see himself doing anything else when he's older. Though, this is mostly due to her own negative self perception that she believes he can never do anything else let alone come up with a different aspiration.</li>
        <li>She grew up in a very toxically masculine household because of her father, who would go as far to say even things like painting were not manly enough and he should be able to tolerate pain, physical and emotional. These experiences led to him finding her identity later in life as a transfeminine person.</li>
        <li>She knows he's not the best at it, but he enjoys alternative fashion and putting outfits together</li>
        <li>He really loves music, particularly general rock, punk, emo, metal, things in that vein. It brings solace to her.</li>
        <li>He uses an axe simply because he found it in the shed in his childhood. She's been keeping it in pretty good condition ever since.</li>
        <li>Kohshiroh was born with heterochromia, her left eye resembling his mother's. This was the cause of his father removing it, but he would claim it was for organ trading all her life.</li>
