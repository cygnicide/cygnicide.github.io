    <div>
      <p style="overflow-y: auto; height: 250px; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; font-size: 13px;">Hiroya is a rather cunning, high maintenance sweet-talker who, despite his upbringing, yearns for and leads the most lavish life he can. He adores going on expensive shopping trips more than anythingâ€¦ as long as he isn't the one paying, anyway. He likes to live as if he were in a romance novel, pursuing love, luxury, and beauty above all, even if his desires tend to be on the unrealistic side. Hiroya is very much a hopeless romantic, viewing romance through a very idealistic lens. He has tried very hard to achieve the "perfect fairytale romance" with someone, only to get his feelings trampled many times prior to meeting Kaneki, whom he believes to be bound to by fate. Out of desperation, Hiroya has been known to go to extremes to get people to notice him and desire him, even if it's very much to his own detriment in the end. Despite hating getting his hands dirty due to seeing it as 'uncouth,' Hiroya is an excellent fighter with amazing flexibility, stealth, and agility. Paired with his cleverness, it's very difficult to land a hit on him. He gained his abilities through his training at Botan Corporation, whom are also responsible for removing his past memories of his family and childhood. From there, all he knew was a sheltered, militaristic lifestyle. As a result, most of his life "experience" would be through romance novels and tv dramas, sprouting these unrealistic ideals he had set. This set him apart from the other soldiers at Botan, making him a frequent punching bag. He would be disrespected by everyone around him for years of his life before escaping out into the real world. Hiroya can be a little bit twisted when he wants to be, such as being willing to play much dirtier than the others. He can also be quite blunt and stubborn, but hide it behind sweet words. He is typically a nice, cheery person, but he's almost never afraid to speak his mind on any given thing. Hiroya likes to act very self confident and self loving as he wants others to view him that way as well as have his confidence rub off on them like a good influence, but he actually doesn't always think that highly of himself. He finds himself to be very 'hard to love' or 'not beautiful enough.' Just not fitting for the leading role of a perfect love story. He finds it hard to be his own individual, rather than just an extension of someone else. He feels sort of lost when Kaneki isn't around, like a fish out of water. </p>

    <div style="font-size: 13px; padding: 20px 20px 20px 0; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>He really enjoys tv dramas and romance novels. He gets so invested that he usually has to have a tissue box at the ready every time, and it completely occupies his mind until he can get to the next part.</li>
        <li>Due to Hiroya's quest for love, he'd date around Botan Corp in "secrecy." However, everyone was just using him with no love for him at all. Not much really stayed a secret, except from him in particular, thus he was given a bad name.</li>
        <li>Hiroya likes to call everyone 'hon' aside from Kaneki, whom he mostly calls 'dear' or 'darling.' It's safe to assume how he feels about you if he doesn't use a pet name for you at all.</li>
        <li>Prior to getting his memories wiped, Hiroya was actually a notorious thief and delinquent, though he stole valuables to keep his starving family afloat. Hiroya is only slightly aware of this. All he knows is what he found in the file room of Botan. That is also how he knows his name is Hiroya.</li>
        <li>People at Botan Corp would call him 'Number 7,' or 'Commander 7.' No one aside from higher ups are given a name at Botan, just a number. It's mostly based on when you're initiated, though for commanders, they get to be at the top.</li>
        <li>He used to borrow all his clothes from Kaneki because the only one he had to his name was his Botan uniform.</li>
        <li>Despite being in the mafia now, he still wears his Botan uniform because it was custom tailored to suit his flexibility and style of combat. He considered dyeing it pink with resounding disapproval from his friends.</li>
        <li>He loves "girly" activities and things like shopping, cute outfits, perfume, makeup, etc which all go on Kaneki's credit card. That being said, he faced a lot of abuse and ridicule at Botan Corp for his personality and interests which was the start of his disdain.</li>
        <li>Thinks he can speak French well. Cannot speak French well.</li>
        <li>He has a million different aspirations he can't choose from. He loves the sound of anything glamorous that puts him in the limelight. One day he'll be dead set on becoming an actor, the next he'll go on about modeling...</li>
      </ul>
