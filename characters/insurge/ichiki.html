      <ul>
        <li>He was born into a family of musicians. His father was a guitarist in a world renowned classic rock band, his mother (though absent due to divorce) is a powerful vocalist of her band, and his older brother (unfortunately killed) was also a guitarist, following in his father's footsteps.</li>
        <li>Ichiki wanted to be like his father too, so he also took up guitar. His father passed down his guitar to Ichiki's brother at first, but following his passing, it was again passed down to Ichiki.</li>
        <li>He used to play in his own band with friends that was on the rise until he finally got revenge on his brother's killers, ending up in mafia trouble. He became a member soon after, having to leave his band.</li>
        <li>Ever since becoming a mafioso, Ichiki never found the confidence to publicly get back into music, instead only playing for himself in private. He only found the courage to after Eisuke's very blunt spiel about everyone's fear of doing what they want to do in life and letting them be chained by the mafia forever. </li>
        <li>Ichiki is quite perverted, though thankfully not in the degenerate sense. He tries and fails to get women to like him, and even has the same struggle with men.</li>
        <li>He has a crush on Kohshiroh which, even in all their time together including the years they spent isolated with each other, Kohshiroh never got the hint and seemed disinterested. Ichiki is only kind of jealous of Eisuke.</li>
        <li>Though usually rowdy and reminiscent of a frat boy, he can be very down to Earth when he wants to be. He gives some pretty weird advice, but when you finally figure out what he was trying to say, you perhaps start to think he's a little smarter than he seems.</li>
        <li>Oddly enough Ichiki actually has two different guitars. Though they both look identical, the one he brings to battle is a replica, properly reinforced to be ideal for bashing enemies, even those of the metal variety.</li>
        <li>Ichiki is naturally muscular just like his mother. Despite having the bigger muscles, he can't ever seem to beat Makoto in a spar...</li>
        <li>Despite his chill and friendly demeanor, Ichiki can get incredibly violent when you hurt his loved ones. For instance, the mafiosos that killed his brother were practically unrecognizable by the end of it...</li>
