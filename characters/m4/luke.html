    <div>
      <p style="overflow-y: auto; height: 250px; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; font-size: 13px;">Luke is a rather quiet and reserved person who, like his muse abilities, can have a fiery side when provoked. He tries his best to keep his mellow composure, but deep down is quite easy to anger. Winky likes to theorize that this was specifically caused by his muse abilities, as he wasn't quite like this beforehand. He's is a bit gullible, sometimes confusing jokes for reality, and getting incredibly embarrassed after making these confusions. Luke has trouble making and keeping friends which has really decreased his confidence. He's been abandoned quite frequently, though he's very unsure as to why. Thus, he struggles to trust other people or rely on them. He becomes very desperate and frenzied when he gets the feeling people will leave him again, causing him to do very reckless things even if it means people will get hurt. But he's since learned that all the people that had left him never truly cared about him, and it's the people like Winky who stay who are his real friends. Nowadays, while he can never quite get over his fears, he has made better friends that he tries his best to open up to. He's very protective and always willing to fight for them. Luke is an avid drummer, loving to play ever since he was little. Practicing would be difficult due to his parents' disappointment in this choice of hobby, but he was able to learn and become quite talented through sheer determination. He now plays for his own band that's rising in popularity. As of the band's revival, he was encouraged to learn vocals as well due to being the band's leader and lyricist, now delivering powerful vocals that well-accompany his captivating writing. Due to his harsh upbringing, he speaks in a sort of polite manner that's difficult to shake. Thus, he's viewed as a 'doormat' by others, and usually on the receiving end of antics. He's not one to speak up or defend himself when he's being bullied or discomforted, and just takes the hits as they come. Completely contrary to how he stands up for others. Despite living by himself, Luke isn't the best at taking care of himself, usually being caught up in his interests or busy life. He's known to put others way before himself as well. Not because he particularly wants to neglect himself, it's more so just a habit.</p>

    <div style="font-size: 13px; padding: 20px 20px 20px 0; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>Luke was bullied a lot in middle school, but once he got to high school, girls were really into him. He had multiple girlfriends over the years. He wasn't exactly into most of them, but he didn't want to hurt anyone.</li>
        <li>The one girl he loved asked him out to senior prom, but Winky secretly sabotaged the date by putting laxative chocolates in her locker, causing her to have to skip out on prom. Luke brought Winky as a friend instead. Winky has tried to sabotage all of Luke's romantic relationships, actually. But usually it doesn't go his way.</li>
        <li>Luke started a band called 'Hallowed Dead' with his new friends upon moving to Muse City. Unfortunately they abandoned him, but he started up the band again with NEO, Jada, and Cal. Plus Winky as their producer.</li>
        <li>Luke really loves sharks, as well as other sea creatures but mostly sharks. He gets teased for dating a blue man with shark teeth because of this love, but he swears it was a coincidence.</li>
        <li>His muse powers make him very weak against the cold. Sometimes when it's too cold, his flames will just fizzle out. </li>
        <li>Winky says Luke's assigned animal would be a cute dog that thinks they're actually tough.</li>
        <li>His parents were very against him playing the drums, let alone getting into music at all, not because it's bad, but because it's not lucrative. Despite being an adult now, they tried very hard to stop him from moving to Muse City to no avail. </li>
        <li>Luke's parents also didn't approve of Winky at all and banned him from seeing him many times. They did not succeed as he would find a way to see him outside of school frequently.</li>
        <li>Shark gummies are the way to his heart. He doesn't buy any for himself because Winky gets really happy when he gives them to him.</li>
        <li>Luke wanted Cal to be Hallowed Dead's vocalist since he is experienced, but Cal refused, believing Luke should do it as the leader and songwriter. He began taking lessons from Cal and the internet. Before he was very unconfident and uncertain, but now, he delivers unique and powerful vocals beyond what he ever believed he could do.</li>
