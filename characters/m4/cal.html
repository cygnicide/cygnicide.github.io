      <ul>
        <li>He considers his muse power to be a curse rather than a blessing. He has no clue why the Elder Muses made him into an immortal demon-like "monster," but he certainly has no respect for them.</li>
        <li>His immortality has no loopholes. Even lethal hits are instantly reverted as if they were never there. He tends to have many existential crises when thinking about his own fate.</li>
        <li>He is a bit of a leech, never really bothering to get his own job other than music which barely pays. He usually gets everything from Hiyori, and previously without them, resorted to thievery.</li>
        <li>He constantly deals with voices in his head due to the "demonic entities" that reside within him. They have a tendency to lead him towards very bad decisions. He tries his best not to listen to them, but it's a bit hard not to. </li>
        <li>He used to be in a solo band which he built from the ground up. It was a miracle that it even took off, but he grew very popular for the band's short existence. He was known for his strange obsessive lyrics...</li>
        <li>Luke wanted Cal to be Hallowed Dead's vocalist since he is experienced, but Cal refused, believing Luke should do it as the leader and songwriter. He began taking lessons from Cal and the internet. Following Cal's experience with his former band, he really didn't want to be the star anymore.</li>
        <li>Cal got his muse powers at a very young age, so due to hating his family, he ran off on his own all the way to Muse City. He would run into Hiyori and their family would take him in as a guest.</li>
        <li>He's a big recluse, and it's very rare to see him outside unless it's for a band related matter. Hiyori tries very hard to get him to go out more.</li>
        <li>He's very much afraid of himself. He frequently warns others to stay far away from him, but unlike himself, his friends don't think there's anything to fear. Everyday that they don't take him seriously, he gets more afraid.</li>
        <li>He's a little unpredictable as one second he can be stoic and intimidating, but the next he's incredibly childish and easygoing.</li>
