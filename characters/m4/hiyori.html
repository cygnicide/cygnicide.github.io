      <ul>
        <li>They own a dog named Lemon Drop, or just Lemon for short. She's a Papillon they found on the street.</li>
        <li>She took both piano and violin lessons at their parents' order. She enjoyed it at first, earning herself the title of Muse of Serenade.</li>
        <li>As time went on, Hiyori got really into idols and wanted to be just like them, "rebelling" against classical music entirely. Their parents' succumbed to their demands and was able to get them a false MPcore</li>
        <li>He absolutely loves shopping, however he has ended up with a big hoard of possessions that just keeps growing. He also loves making other people carry his bags.</li>
        <li>They like to refer to their unitmates as their 'sisters' though they don't seem to consider them family, per se. It's more just a term of endearment of sorts.</li>
        <li>Hiyori is very into dramas or just any media that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Though they tend to get a little too into it, and are prone to "playing the part" every now and then.</li>
        <li>Her false MPcore hurts her to use since it's both fabricated and doesn't align with what the Elder Muses assigned. Thankfully, after witnessing her efforts and passion, she was declared a real Muse of Idols.</li>
        <li>Hiyori comes from a wealthy family. His older brother is the family heir, leaving him a bit neglected as he is viewed as less important in the grand scheme of things. He typically chooses to stay out of the way of his family entirely to go do his own thing.</li>
        <li>They're very adamant about making others around them happy, so they like to put on a happy face no matter how they're feeling inside. This ties in a lot to their whole 'sunshine' gimmick and their admiration of idols. It's rather easy to tell how Hiyori is feeling on the inside, though. They're very bad at actually hiding it. </li>
        <li>She is often enthralled by the lives of average folk and is excited by trying out those kinds of things. She looks kinda ridiculous to everyone else but at least she is having fun.</li>
