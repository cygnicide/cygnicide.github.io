    <div>
      <p style="overflow-y: auto; height: 250px; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; font-size: 13px;">Winky is a very eccentric individual, often saying or doing bizarre things. He simultaneously has a crude and silly lighthearted sense of humor with little filter or room awareness. He's very hyperactive, always having boundless energy to zip around and talk endlessly (and loudly) at any hour of the day. All around, he does try to be friendly with everyone he meets, although many aren't willing to return the favor, seeing him as strange. He hates being hurtful towards others and starting conflict even if they mistreat him, being overly tolerant of any such thing that comes his way. He has only been known to snap in very specific circumstance, in which he can get quite emotional and reckless against his better judgement. All of which have been over his partner Luke, whom he spent his childhood being incredibly possessive of, warding off as many potential suitors as possible. Despite Winky's demeanor, he's very determined and adamant about being seen as cute by others, and gets very upset when he's (very often) told otherwise by everyone but Luke. Winky is very attached to bunnies to the point of identifying himself with them as well, which contributes a lot to his need to be cute. He likes to call himself an "alien bunny DJ from outer space," though no one can quite gauge if this is a genuine belief or Winky playing around as he does. Winky is relatively carefree, just doing whatever he pleases and not letting anything tie him down. He has an almost concerning lack of fear or shame in most situations, being able to do things like striking crazy conversations with strangers. He's also very much a people pleaser, going hand in hand with his hatred of conflict. He tries his hardest to get everyone to like him and make them happy, even at his own detriment. Winky is a very kind person, always ensuring everyone's wellbeing and happiness. He absolutely loves spoiling his favorite people. Even if he's always loud and hyper, he can be down to Earth and a good listener when he needs to be, doing his best to advise those around him and work out their problems. Winky is blind, but has been given "vision" through his headset. It records his surroundings then projects it into his head like a daydream. He has had severe degenerative blindness since infancy, currently no longer having vision at all. He doesn't seem to mind his lack of vision due to loving his headset so much and almost always living this way, only being bothered when he gives it too much thought.</p>

    <div style="font-size: 13px; padding: 20px 20px 20px 0; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>Winky's rabbit is usually referred to as Walnut, but his full name is actually Prince Doctor Walnut Mcfluffernutter the Third</li>
        <li>He's very into DJing and does so at a club that's quickly gaining traction, mostly thanks to himself.</li>
        <li>He prefers to stay away from alcohol because he can never feel the effects until he's in way too deep. Thus he sticks to his favorite non-alcoholic drink, root beer.</li>
        <li>Winky is one of the lucky muses who ended up with multiple powers. It's uncertain why some muses receive this extra special gift. Perhaps they just have that much potential within them.</li>
        <li>Winky, albeit in a harmless way, is incredibly strange. Bizarre and eccentric to his core. Completely unpredictable, even. He can be overwhelming to keep up with, but he adores anyone who is up to the challenge.</li>
        <li>He calls himself 'Winky' for mostly unknown reasons, but he claims it sounds like a cute rabbit name which is a big motivator. He likes to call himself a "DJ Alien Rabbit" which no one can gauge the seriousness of. Obviously he's a human, it's more so, what does Winky himself believe?</li>
        <li>Only people close to him can call him Kian, and he tries to avoid letting others find out his real name. It's a bit confusing, as he doesn't even hate his name and loves when Luke or his dad call him Kian.</li>
        <li>Winky pretty much never gets tired physically unless he's tired mentally. He can skate around for hours no problem, in fact that's one of his favorite activities. He's known to get very antsy if he sits in place for too long, and will have to excuse himself to go run and come back.</li>
        <li>Underneath Winky's headset, his eyes are a cloudy grey color. This is pretty much due to his blindness. His eyes used to be bright yellow.</li>
        <li>Winky awards Luke the highest honor of being the "only thing he loves more than bunnies." However, he says that if this honor must be revoked at any point, that basically spells death. It's hard to say if he's serious.</li>
      </ul>
